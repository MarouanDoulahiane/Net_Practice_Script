# Welcome to NetPractice!
#### About The Project:
This project is about system administration. In this article, I'll write down everything you need to know about the project, from beginning to end. I hope you find this helpful! ðŸ˜‡
####  In this project, we'll aboard multiple topics, including:

 - What is  a Network?
 - Types of Networks
 
 ## What is a Network?
A network refers to two or more connected devices that can share resources.

## Types of Networks

 - ### Local Area Network (LAN)
	 - A Local Area Network (LAN) is a small network that connects computers and devices within a limited area, like a home, office, or school. It allows them to communicate and share resources, such as files and printers, easily.
- ### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
	- A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a type of network that covers a larger geographical area than a Local Area Network (LAN) but is smaller than a Wide Area Network (WAN). It typically spans a city or a large campus, connecting multiple LANs within that specific metropolitan area. MANs facilitate communication and resource sharing across various local networks.
- ### Wide Area Network (WAN)
	- A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a type of network that covers a broad geographical area, connecting multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) or Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). WANs are designed to facilitate communication and data exchange over long distances, often across cities, countries, or even continents. They use various communication technologies, such as leased lines, satellites, or public networks, to connect and enable the exchange of information between distant locations.
